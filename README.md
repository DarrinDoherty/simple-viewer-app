# Simple Viewer App

Copyright Â© 2018 Bentley Systems, Incorporated. All rights reserved.

An iModel.js sample application that demonstrates opening an iModel and viewing its data. The data is presented using the following components:

- _Viewport_: Renders geometric data onto an HTMLCanvasElement.
- _Tree_: Displays a hierarchical view of iModel contents.
- _Property Grid_: Displays properties of selected element(s).
- _Table_: Displays element properties in a tabular format.

This app serves as a guide on how you can embed one or more of these components into your own application.
See http://imodeljs.org for comprehensive documentation on the iModel.js API and the various constructs used in this sample.

## Development Setup

* Use the [Developer Registration](https://imodeljs.github.io/iModelJs-docs-output/getting-started/#developer-registration) page to register your application and create a sample project.

  Note: If you are just testing on localhost you can use the default registration included in this sample. However, it's recommended that you complete the registration, especially since registration is a requirement before the application can be deployed. For more information, see the section on [authorization](https://imodeljs.github.io/iModelJs-docs-output/learning/common/accesstoken/).

* Edit [src/common/configuration.ts](./src/common/configuration.ts) to set the values you obtain after registration.

* Install the dependencies
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

* Start the application
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```
  The above script automatically starts both the Web and Electron applications.

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the following:

- [Dependencies](./package.json) required for iModel.js-based frontend applications.
- [Scripts](./package.json) recommended to build and run iModel.js-based applications.
- How to set up a simple backend for
  [web](./src/backend/web/main.ts) and
  [electron](./src/backend/electron/main.ts).
- How to set up a simple [frontend for web and electron](./src/frontend/api/SimpleViewerApp.ts).
- How to [implement OIDC sign-in](./docs/oidc.md) to get access to iModels on iModelHub.
- How to [consume](./src/frontend/components/App.tsx) iModel.js React components.
- How to implement unified selection between a
  [viewport](./src/frontend/components/Viewport.tsx),
  [tree](./src/frontend/components/Tree.tsx),
  [property grid](./src/frontend/components/Properties.tsx) and a
  [table](./src/frontend/components/Table.tsx).
- How to include
  [tools](./src/frontend/components/Toolbar.tsx) in a
  [viewport](./src/frontend/components/Viewport.tsx).
